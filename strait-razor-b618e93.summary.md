## Gates

| Gate | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Available | PASS | the pinned public source exists |
| Installs | PASS | the environment builds from source |
| Runs | — | it executes end-to-end without crashing |
| Runs + Expected IO | — | it produces a non-empty file in the declared format |
| Runs + Plausible output | — | its output looks like plausible genotype-bearing data (declared columns, DNA sequences, integer read counts, and enough recognisable forensic loci) |

## Output content (plausibility evidence)

- Sequence records: **0** (malformed: 0)
- STR loci detected: **0**
- Total reads across calls: **0** (deepest single sequence: 0)



## Verification matrix

| Leg | Available | Result | Errors reported | Dataset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| STRhub fixture | N/A | N/A | — | — |
| External data | yes | — | — | NIST mds2-2157, Illumina STR (ForenSeq slice, donor NTD01) |

## README check (advisory)

Score: **5/5**. Advisory only; does not affect the execution badge.

- PASS install
- PASS command
- PASS input
- PASS output
- PASS dependencies

## Scope (read this)

Executed end-to-end in the stated environment with output in the expected format. Concerns reproducible execution only; no claim of accuracy, casework fitness, or regulatory validation.

This is **not** a claim that the genotypes are correct, nor that the tool is fit for casework or meets any regulatory standard. Concordance against known truth is out of scope.

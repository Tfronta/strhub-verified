## Gates

| Gate | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Available | PASS | the pinned public source exists |
| Installs | PASS | the environment builds from source |
| Runs | PASS | it executes end-to-end without crashing |
| Runs + Expected IO | PASS | it produces a non-empty file in the declared format |
| Runs + Plausible output | — | its output looks like plausible genotype-bearing data (declared columns, DNA sequences, integer read counts, and enough recognisable forensic loci) |

## Verification matrix

| Leg | Available | Result | Dataset |
|---|---|---|---|
| Your data | yes | PASS | — |
| External data | yes | PASS | 1000 Genomes Illumina 30x — hg38 CODIS slice |

## Scope (read this)

Executed end-to-end in the stated environment with output in the expected format. Concerns reproducible execution only; no claim of accuracy, casework fitness, or regulatory validation.

This is **not** a claim that the genotypes are correct, nor that the tool is fit for casework or meets any regulatory standard. Concordance against known truth is out of scope.
